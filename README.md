Simple application with Spring Cache
<br/>
<br/> 
### Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the ```main``` method in the ```com.example.springcacheexample.SpringCacheExampleApplication``` class from your IDE.

- Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
- Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
- Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
- Open Eclipse
  - File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
  - Select the project
- Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
- Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application
  
Alternatively you can use the  link [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html "Spring Boot Maven plugin") like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
